# Purpose

The purpose of thisshort and simple Python script is to quickly complete the survey found at the top of each and every Taco Bell receipt. I found that it is somewhat long and annoying to take mannually and I feel that its length is a major deterrant to those wanting to take the survey.

Additionally, taking the survey and naming the employee listed on the reciept earns the workers at my local locations monetary compensation per survey mention and I value their hard work.

# Requirements

Outlined below are the required installations to make the magic happen

### Python

### Selenium

### Google Chrome

# Usage

There are two ways to execute this python script: The included .bat file and via the CMD Console. While they both work the same, the .bat file is included for the simplicity of the user.

## Using the .Bat File:
 1. Navigate to the directory where the .bat file is located
 2. If you are using Windows 10, simply double click the TakeSurvey.bat
## Via CMD Line:
1. Open your terminal/CMD Console
2. Navigate to the directory where the .py file is located
3. Enter the command 
```
python Survey.py
```
4. Press Enter
